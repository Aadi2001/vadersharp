Sentiment analysis using VADER with C#

"VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media."

Previously this package was only available in python. I wanted to use it in C# - Voila!

NuGet coming soon
