# VaderSharp - Sentiment analysis with C#

"VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media."

Previously VADER was only available in python (https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment). I wanted to use it in C# so ported it over.

NuGet coming soon
